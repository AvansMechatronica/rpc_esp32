# ESP32 NodeMCU RPC Library
This is a library and firmware for remote procedure calls (RPC) on ESP32 NodeMCU devices, with a Python client and GUI for testing. The library supports both USB serial and WiFi communication modes, allowing users to control GPIO, PWM, and optional hardware modules (ADC, DAC, DIO, OLED, pulse control, QC7366 counter) remotely.
